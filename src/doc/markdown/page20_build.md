# Building JaiaBot software

JaiaBot development is done on Ubuntu Linux, generally the latest LTS version.

## Dependencies

The JaiaBot software depends on Goby3, MOOS, and other packages.

When using the `jaiabot` Debian packages (see the CI/CD section below), these dependencies are automatically installed by `apt`.

When building from source, these can be installed from the regular Ubuntu package repositories plus the `packages.gobysoft.org` repository:

```
# add packages.gobysoft.org to your apt sources
echo "deb http://packages.gobysoft.org/ubuntu/release/ `lsb_release -c -s`/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gobysoft_release.list
# install the public key for packages.gobysoft.org
sudo apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 19478082E2F8D3FE
# update apt
sudo apt update
# install the required dependencies
sudo apt install libgoby3-dev libgoby3-moos-dev libgoby3-gui-dev gpsd libnanopb-dev nanopb python3-protobuf
# install the build tools necessary
sudo apt install cmake build-essential
```

## CMake

The `jaiabot` software is configured using CMake which (by default) then generates Makefiles that the `make` tool uses to invoke the C++ compiler and linker.

This process is summarized by:

```
# make a directory for the generated objects
mkdir -p build/amd64
cd build/amd64
# configure the project
cmake ../..
# build it (using make by default)
cmake --build .
```

This project provides a convenience script called `build.sh` that runs cmake to configure and build the project (using as many jobs as your machine has processors). The build.sh script segregates the CMake working directory by machine architecture (e.g. build/amd64, build/arm64, etc.). Additionally, you can set the environmental variables `JAIABOT_CMAKE_FLAGS` and/or `JAIABOT_MAKE_FLAGS` to pass command line parameters to CMake (during configure) or make, respectively.

Some examples:

Basic build:
```
./build.sh
```

Build documentation as well:
```
export JAIABOT_CMAKE_FLAGS="-Dbuild_doc=ON"
./build.sh
```

## CI/CD

Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) are software best practices to ensure that code is quickly and easily integrated and tested. The CI part is managed by a standard Git workflow of committing regularly, pushing changes to Github.com, and integrating back to the `1.y` "main" branch using the pull request feature on Github.

The CD part is managed by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), which is a cloud-based configurable build and test system. The `.circleci/config.yml` file configures the actions ("workflow") performed by the CircleCI servers. Open source projects get four parallel free build servers from CircleCI.

We use CircleCI to do two main types of builds:

- "basic" code build and run unit tests
- Debian package build to produce .deb packages that can be installed by `apt`
    - "continuous" builds that are run with each commit to the `1.y` branch (usually the result of a pull request merge).
    - "release" builds that are run with each release (`git tag`)


The interaction between the developers and the automated CI/CD system is summarized in the following figure:

![CI / CD diagram](../figures/ci-cd.png)

### Feature development / bug fix

When the developer is working on a new feature or fixing a bug, he or she *branches* the code into a "feature branch", then incrementally commits and pushes these changes. Each commit that is pushed triggers a basic build on CircleCI to ensure that the committed code compiles correctly and the existing unit tests pass.

### After the pull request is merged

Once the developer has completed his or her feature or bug fix, he or she puts a "pull request" up on Github to be reviewed by another member of the software team. The pull request is generally set to merge the feature branch (e.g. "my-new-feature-xyz") into the "main" branch (`1.y` in our case). After review (using the GitHub UI), the reviewer merges the pull request and this automatically triggers the CircleCI system to do a package build of the code. These packages (.deb packages for installing on Ubuntu) are pushed the **continuous** repository on packages.gobysoft.org. At this point, they can be installed using `apt` onto any system with that repository installed:

```
# add packages.gobysoft.org to your apt sources
echo "deb http://packages.gobysoft.org/ubuntu/continuous/ `lsb_release -c -s`/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gobysoft_continuous.list
# install the public key for packages.gobysoft.org
sudo apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 19478082E2F8D3FE
sudo apt update
# install the jaia code
sudo apt install jaiabot-apps jaiabot-python
# optional: compiled documentation to /usr/share/doc/jaiabot/html
sudo apt install jaiabot-doc
# optional: Goby clang tool interface definitions (publish/subscribe API) to /usr/share/jaiabot/interfaces
sudo apt install jaiabot-interfaces
```

### After a release is made

Once the decision has been made to release the software, a tag is made on the git repository and pushed to Github. The creation of a new tag automatically triggers a CircleCI build that is the same as the continuous build but is pushed to a different repository:

To use the release repository, run these commands:
```
# add packages.gobysoft.org to your apt sources
echo "deb http://packages.gobysoft.org/ubuntu/release/ `lsb_release -c -s`/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gobysoft_release.list
# install the public key for packages.gobysoft.org
sudo apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 19478082E2F8D3FE
sudo apt update
# install jaia packages as needed...
```

### Package tagging

Debian packages are given versions based on the git tag version (for "release" packages) or the last tagged release plus the git hash (for "continuous" packages).

The `~` used by Debian that sorts **before** any other versions is not allowed as a symbol in git tags, so we substitute `_` instead. For example `git tag 1.0.0_beta1` becomes Debian version `1.0.0~beta1` which is treated as an earlier version than `1.0.0`.

Additionally the Ubuntu version that the package is build for is appended to the version name as `~ubuntuXX.YY.Z`

Examples:

- `git tag 1.0.0` built on Ubuntu 20.04 "focal" becomes Debian version `1.0.0-0~ubuntu20.04.1`
- git hash 8f9b675, which is 5 commits after `git tag 1.0.0_alpha1` built on Ubuntu 18.04 "xenial" becomes Debian version `1.0.0~alpha1+5+g8f9b675-0~ubuntu18.04.1`

This scheme ensures that continuous packages are considered to always be newer versions (by the rules of `apt`) than the last release. This also ensures that each version can be tracked back to the git tag or git hash from which it was built.


## Cross-compiling locally using Docker

For rapid turnaround development where it is infeasible to wait for the CI/CD packages to complete, we can cross-compile for the `jaiabot` code for the ARM64 target (Raspberry Pi) using a Docker container that holds all the appropriate dependencies:

### Install Docker

```
# Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
# Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
# Use the following command to set up the stable repository.
echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
# Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
# Create the docker group and add your user.
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
# Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.
docker run hello-world
# Configure Docker to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
```

### Build the image

To create the docker image initially (should only need to be done initially and whenever there are updates to the dependencies):
```bash
cd jaiabot/.docker/focal/arm64
docker build -t gobysoft/jaiabot-ubuntu-arm64:20.04.1 .
# optionally, push to docker hub
docker push gobysoft/jaiabot-ubuntu-arm64:20.04.1
```

### Cross-compile in the container

Then to cross-compile using this image:

```bash
cd jaiabot
# run the docker container interactively
docker run -v `pwd`:/home/ubuntu/jaiabot -w /home/ubuntu/jaiabot -it gobysoft/jaiabot-ubuntu-arm64:20.04.1 
# update any dependencies since the image was created (not required if you've recently built the image)
apt update && apt upgrade -y
# actually build the code
./scripts/arm64_build.sh
```

Or simply use the all-in-one-script:

```
./scripts/docker_arm64_build.sh
```


### Copy the binaries to the Raspberry Pi

If you rsync the contents of `jaiabot/build/bin` and `jaiabot/build/lib` to the Raspberry Pi at `/home/ubuntu/jaiabot` you should be able to run them successfully.

(This assumes that `/home/ubuntu/jaiabot/build` exists on the Raspberry Pi, if not, `mkdir` it first):
```
cd jaiabot
rsync -aP build/bin build/lib ubuntu@172.20.11.10:/home/ubuntu/jaiabot/build
```
