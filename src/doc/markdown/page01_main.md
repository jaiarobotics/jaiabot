## Documentation Information

The documentation for this project consists of this set of Markdown files (residing in `src/doc/markdown`) which are compiled by the Doxygen tool along with [the specially formatted comments](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) in the source code files to produce a complete HTML documentation package.

This package is distributed via the `jaiabot-hydro-doc` Debian package, see [Building and CI/CD](page20_build.md) for further details. For convenience, the documentation for the latest tagged release of jaiabot-hydro is hosted at <https://gobysoft.org/doc/jaiabot-hydro/html/>.
